  abstract    = {We propose the use of data transformations as a defense against evasion attacks on ML classifiers. We present and investigate strategies for incorporating a variety of data transformations including dimensionality reduction via Principal Component Analysis and data "anti-whitening" to enhance the resilience of machine learning, targeting both the classification and the training phase. We empirically evaluate and demonstrate the feasibility of linear transformations of data as a defense mechanism against evasion attacks using multiple real-world datasets. Our key findings are that the defense is (i) effective against the best known evasion attacks from the literature, resulting in a two-fold increase in the resources required by a white-box adversary with knowledge of the defense for a successful attack, (ii) applicable across a range of ML classifiers, including Support Vector Machines and Deep Neural Networks, and (iii) generalizable to multiple application domains, including image classification and human activity classification.},

  abstract      = {As an initial assessment, over 480,000 labeled virtual images of normal highway driving were readily generated in Grand Theft Auto V's virtual environment. Using these images, a CNN was trained to detect following distance to cars/objects ahead, lane markings, and driving angle (angular heading relative to lane centerline): all variables necessary for basic autonomous driving. Encouraging results were obtained when tested on over 50,000 labeled virtual images from substantially different GTA-V driving environments. This initial assessment begins to define both the range and scope of the labeled images needed for training as well as the range and scope of labeled images needed for testing the definition of boundaries and limitations of trained networks. It is the efficacy and flexibility of a "GTA-V"-like virtual environment that is expected to provide an efficient well-defined foundation for the training and testing of Convolutional Neural Networks for safe driving. Additionally, described is the Princeton Virtual Environment (PVE) for the training, testing and enhancement of safe driving AI, which is being developed using the video-game engine Unity. PVE is being developed to recreate rare but critical corner cases that can be used in re-training and enhancing machine learning models and understanding the limitations of current self driving models. The Florida Tesla crash is being used as an initial reference.},

  abstract    = {When deploying machine learning models in real-world applications, an open-world learning framework is needed to deal with both normal in-distribution inputs and undesired out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. Open-world learning frameworks include OOD detectors that aim to discard input examples which are not from the same distribution as the training data of machine learning classifiers. However, our understanding of current OOD detectors is limited to the setting of benign OOD data, and an open question is whether they are robust in the presence of adversaries. In this paper, we present the first analysis of the robustness of open-world learning frameworks in the presence of adversaries by introducing and designing \o odAdvExamples. Our experimental results show that current OOD detectors can be easily evaded by slightly perturbing benign OOD inputs, revealing a severe limitation of current open-world learning frameworks. Furthermore, we find that \o odAdvExamples also pose a strong threat to adversarial training based defense methods in spite of their effectiveness against in-distribution adversarial attacks. To counteract these threats and ensure the trustworthy detection of OOD inputs, we outline a preliminary design for a robust open-world machine learning framework.},

While most of the attention has been focused on neural networks, other practical models also suffer from this issue. In this work, we propose an algorithm for evaluating the adversarial robustness of $k$-nearest neighbor classification, i.e., finding a minimum-norm adversarial example. Diverging from previous proposals, we propose the first geometric approach by performing a search that expands outwards from a given input point. On a high level, the search radius expands to the nearby higher-order Voronoi cells until we find a cell that classifies differently from the input point. To scale the algorithm to a large $k$, we introduce approximation steps that find perturbation with smaller norm, compared to the baselines, in a variety of datasets. Furthermore, we analyze the structural properties of a dataset where our approach outperforms the competition.},

Any misclassification of traffic signs can potentially lead to a multitude of disastrous consequences, ranging from a life-threatening accident to even a large-scale interruption of transportation services relying on autonomous cars. In this paper, we propose and examine security attacks against sign recognition systems for Deceiving Autonomous caRs with Toxic Signs (we call the proposed attacks DARTS). In particular, we introduce two novel methods to create these toxic signs. First, we propose Out-of-Distribution attacks, which expand the scope of adversarial examples by enabling the adversary to generate these starting from an arbitrary point in the image space compared to prior attacks which are restricted to existing training/test data (In-Distribution). Second, we present the Lenticular Printing attack, which relies on an optical phenomenon to deceive the traffic sign recognition system. We extensively evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed attacks in both virtual and real-world settings and consider both white-box and black-box threat models. Our results demonstrate that the proposed attacks are successful under both settings and threat models. We further show that Out-of-Distribution attacks can outperform In-Distribution attacks on classifiers defended using the adversarial training defense, exposing a new attack vector for these defenses.},

Our scheme surpasses state-of-the-art defenses on MNIST and CIFAR-10 against l2-perturbation by a significant margin. With our models, the mean perturbation norm required to fool our MNIST model is 3.07 and 2.30 on CIFAR-10. Additionally, we propose a simple certifiable lower bound on the l2-norm of the adversarial perturbation using a more specific version of our scheme, a 1-NN on representations learned by a Lipschitz network. Our model provides a nontrivial average lower bound of the perturbation norm, comparable to other schemes on MNIST with similar clean accuracy.},

  abstract    = {Neural networks' lack of robustness against attacks raises concerns in security-sensitive settings
                 such as autonomous vehicles. While many countermeasures may look promising, only a few withstand rigorous evaluation.
                 Defenses using random transformations (RT) have shown impressive results, particularly BaRT (Raff et al., 2019) on ImageNet.
                 However, this type of defense has not been rigorously evaluated, leaving its robustness properties poorly understood.
                 Their stochastic properties make evaluation more challenging and render many proposed attacks on deterministic models inapplicable.
                 First, we show that the BPDA attack (Athalye et al., 2018a) used in BaRT’s evaluation is ineffective and likely over-estimates its robustness.
                 We then attempt to construct the strongest possible RT defense through the informed selection of transformations and
                 Bayesian optimization for tuning their parameters. Furthermore, we create the strongest possible attack to evaluate our RT defense.
                 Our new attack vastly outperforms the baseline, reducing the accuracy by 83% compared to the 19% reduction by the commonly
                 used EoT attack (4.3x improvement). Our result indicates that the RT defense on Imagenette dataset (ten-class subset of ImageNet)
                 is not robust against adversarial examples. Extending the study further, we use our new attack to adversarially train RT defense
                 (called AdvRT), resulting in a large robustness gain.},

Dual-domain training, optimizing on both clean and adversarial objectives, can help realize a better trade-off between clean accuracy and robustness. In this paper, we develop methods to improve dual-domain training for large adversarial perturbations and complex datasets. We first demonstrate that existing methods suffer from poor performance in this setting, due to a poor training procedure and overfitting to a particular attack. Then, we develop novel methods to address these issues. First, we show that adding KLD regularization to the dual training objective mitigates this overfitting and achieves a better trade-off, on CIFAR-10 and a 10-class subset of ImageNet. Then, inspired by domain adaptation, we develop a new normalization technique, Dual Batch Normalization, to further improve accuracy. Combining these two strategies, our model sets a new state of the art in trade-off performance for dual-domain adversarial training.},

We examine Deep k-Nearest Neighbor (DkNN), a proposed defense that combines k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) and deep learning to improve the model's robustness to adversarial examples. It is challenging to evaluate the robustness of this scheme due to a lack of efficient algorithm for attacking kNN classifiers with large k and high-dimensional data. We propose a heuristic attack that allows us to use gradient descent to find adversarial examples for kNN classifiers, and then apply it to attack the DkNN defense as well. Results suggest that our attack is moderately stronger than any naive attack on kNN and significantly outperforms other attacks on DkNN.},

Our novel Sign Embedding attack exploits the concept of adversarial examples to modify innocuous signs and advertisements in the environment such that they are classified as the adversary's desired traffic sign with high confidence. Our attack greatly expands the scope of the threat posed to AVs since adversaries are no longer restricted to just modifying existing traffic signs as in previous work. Our attack pipeline generates adversarial samples which are robust to the environmental conditions and noisy image transformations present in the physical world. We ensure this by including a variety of possible image transformations in the optimization problem used to generate adversarial samples. We verify the robustness of the adversarial samples by printing them out and carrying out drive-by tests simulating the conditions under which image capture would occur in a real-world scenario. We experimented with physical attack samples for different distances, lighting conditions and camera angles. In addition, extensive evaluations were carried out in the virtual setting for a variety of image transformations. The adversarial samples generated using our method have adversarial success rates in excess of 95\% in the physical as well as virtual settings.},

  title       = {SAT: Improving Adversarial Training via Curriculum-Based Loss Smoothing},
  abstract    = {Adversarial training (AT) has become a popular choice for training robust networks.
                 However, it tends to sacrifice clean accuracy heavily in favor of robustness and suffers
                 from a large generalization error. To address these concerns, we propose Smooth Adversarial
                 Training (SAT), guided by our analysis on the eigenspectrum of the loss Hessian. We
                 find that curriculum learning, a scheme that emphasizes on starting "easy'' and gradually
                 ramping up on the "difficulty'' of training, smooths the adversarial loss landscape
                 for a suitably chosen difficulty metric. We present a general formulation for curriculum
                 learning in the adversarial setting and propose two difficulty metrics based on the
                 maximal Hessian eigenvalue (H-SAT) and the softmax probability (P-SA). We demonstrate
                 that SAT stabilizes network training even for a large perturbation norm and allows
                 the network to operate at a better clean accuracy versus robustness trade-off curve
                 compared to AT. This leads to a significant improvement in both clean accuracy and
                 robustness compared to AT, TRADES, and other baselines. To highlight a few results,
                 our best model improves normal and robust accuracy by 6% and 1% on CIFAR-100 compared
                 to AT, respectively. On Imagenette, a ten-class subset of ImageNet, our model outperforms
                 AT by 23% and 3% on normal and robust accuracy respectively.},

Yet, it remains unstable, with the mechanisms driving this instability poorly understood. In this study, we discover that this instability is primarily driven by a non-smooth optimization landscape and an internal covariate shift phenomenon, and show that Batch Normalization (BN) can effectively mitigate both these issues. Further, we demonstrate that BN universally improves clean and robust performance across various defenses, datasets, and model types, with greater improvement on more difficult tasks. Finally, we confirm BN's heterogeneous distribution issue with mixed-batch training and propose a solution.},

In this context, the ability to distinguish machine-generated text from human-authored content becomes important. Prior works have proposed numerous schemes to watermark text, which would benefit from a systematic evaluation framework. This work focuses on text watermarking techniques - as opposed to image watermarks - and proposes a comprehensive benchmark for them under different tasks as well as practical attacks. We focus on three main metrics: quality, size (e.g. the number of tokens needed to detect a watermark), and tamper-resistance. Current watermarking techniques are good enough to be deployed: Kirchenbauer et al. can watermark Llama2-7B-chat with no perceivable loss in quality in under 100 tokens, and with good tamper-resistance to simple attacks, regardless of temperature. We argue that watermark indistinguishability is too strong a requirement: schemes that slightly modify logit distributions outperform their indistinguishable counterparts with no noticeable loss in generation quality. We publicly release our benchmark.},

  abstract     = {Machine learning models are known to be susceptible to adversarial perturbation. One famous attack is the adversarial patch, a sticker with a particularly crafted pattern that makes the model incorrectly predict the object it is placed on. This attack presents a critical threat to cyber-physical systems that rely on cameras such as autonomous cars. Despite the significance of the problem, conducting research in this setting has been difficult; evaluating attacks and defenses in the real world is exceptionally costly while synthetic data are unrealistic. In this work, we propose the REAP (REalistic Adversarial Patch) Benchmark, a digital benchmark that allows the user to evaluate patch attacks on real images, and under real-world conditions. Built on top of the Mapillary Vistas dataset, our benchmark contains over 14,000 traffic signs. Each sign is augmented with a pair of geometric and lighting transformations, which can be used to apply a digitally generated patch realistically onto the sign, while matching real-world conditions. Using our benchmark, we perform the first large-scale assessments of adversarial patch attacks under realistic conditions. Our experiments suggest that adversarial patch attacks may present a smaller threat than previously believed and that the success rate of an attack on simpler digital simulations is not predictive of its actual effectiveness in practice.},

These attacks have mainly been applied directly to standalone neural networks. However, in practice, ML models are just one component of a larger learning system. We find that by adding a single preprocessor in front of a classifier, state-of-the-art query-based attacks are up to seven\texttimes{} less effective at attacking a prediction pipeline than at attacking the model alone. We explain this discrepancy by the fact that most preprocessors introduce some notion of invariance to the input space. Hence, attacks that are unaware of this invariance inevitably waste a large number of queries to re-discover or overcome it. We, therefore, develop techniques to (i) reverse-engineer the preprocessor and then (ii) use this extracted information to attack the end-to-end system. Our preprocessors extraction method requires only a few hundred queries, and our preprocessor-aware attacks recover the same efficacy as when attacking the model alone.

Empirically, our part-based models achieve both higher accuracy and higher adversarial robustness than a ResNet-50 baseline on all three datasets. For instance, the clean accuracy of our part models is up to 15 percentage points higher than the baseline's, given the same level of robustness. Our experiments indicate that these models also reduce texture bias and yield better robustness against common corruptions and spurious correlations.

  abstract      = {In the context of the rising interest in code language models (code LMs) and vulnerability detection, we study the effectiveness of code LMs for detecting vulnerabilities. Our analysis reveals significant shortcomings in existing vulnerability datasets, including poor data quality, low label accuracy, and high duplication rates, leading to unreliable model performance in realistic vulnerability detection scenarios. Additionally, the evaluation methods used with these datasets are not representative of real-world vulnerability detection. To address these challenges, we introduce PrimeVul, a new dataset for training and evaluating code LMs for vulnerability detection. PrimeVul incorporates a novel set of data labeling techniques that achieve comparable label accuracy to human-verified benchmarks while significantly expanding the dataset. It also implements a rigorous data de-duplication and chronological data splitting strategy to mitigate data leakage issues, alongside introducing more realistic evaluation metrics and settings. This comprehensive approach aims to provide a more accurate assessment of code LMs' performance in real-world conditions. Evaluating code LMs on PrimeVul reveals that existing benchmarks significantly overestimate the performance of these models. For instance, a state-of-the-art 7B model scored 68.26\% F1 on BigVul but only 3.09\% F1 on PrimeVul. Attempts to improve performance through advanced training techniques and larger models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 were unsuccessful, with results akin to random guessing in the most stringent settings. These findings underscore the considerable gap between current capabilities and the practical requirements for deploying code LMs in security roles, highlighting the need for more innovative research in this domain.},

However, LLMs are vulnerable to prompt-injection attacks: a class of attacks that hijack the model's instruction-following abilities, changing responses to prompts to undesired, possibly malicious ones. In this work, we introduce Jatmo, a method for generating task-specific models resilient to prompt-injection attacks. Jatmo leverages the fact that LLMs can only follow instructions once they have undergone instruction tuning. It harnesses a teacher instruction-tuned model to generate a task-specific dataset, which is then used to fine-tune a base model (i.e., a non-instruction-tuned model). Jatmo only needs a task prompt and a dataset of inputs for the task: it uses the teacher model to generate outputs. For situations with no pre-existing datasets, Jatmo can use a single example, or in some cases none at all, to produce a fully synthetic dataset. Our experiments on six tasks show that Jatmo models provide the same quality of outputs on their specific task as standard LLMs, while being resilient to prompt injections. The best attacks succeeded in less than 0.5\% of cases against our models, versus over 90\% success rate against GPT-3.5-Turbo.

In this work, we introduce the Proxy-Guided Attack on LLMs (PAL), the first optimization-based attack on LLMs in a black-box query-only setting. In particular, it relies on a surrogate model to guide the optimization and a sophisticated loss designed for real-world LLM APIs. Our attack achieves 84\% attack success rate (ASR) on GPT-3.5-Turbo and 48\% on Llama-2-7B, compared to 4\% for the current state of the art. We also propose GCG++, an improvement to the GCG attack that reaches 94\% ASR on white-box Llama-2-7B, and the Random-Search Attack on LLMs (RAL), a strong but simple baseline for query-based attacks. We believe the techniques proposed in this work will enable more comprehensive safety testing of LLMs and, in the long term, the development of better security guardrails.

  abstract      = {Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) enable exciting LLM-integrated applications, which perform text-based tasks by utilizing their advanced language understanding capabilities. However, as LLMs have improved, so have the attacks against them. Prompt injection attacks are an important threat: they trick the model to deviate from the original application's instructions and instead follow user directives. These attacks rely on the LLM's ability to follow instructions and inability to separate the prompts and user data. We introduce structured queries, a general approach to tackle this problem. Structured queries separate prompts and data into two channels. We implement a system that supports structured queries. This system is made of (1) a secure front-end that formats a prompt and user data into a special format, and (2) a specially trained LLM that can produce high-quality outputs from these inputs. The LLM is trained using a novel fine-tuning strategy: we convert a base (non-instruction-tuned) LLM to a structured instruction-tuned model that will only follow instructions in the prompt portion of a query. To do so, we augment standard instruction tuning datasets with examples that also include instructions in the data portion of the query, and fine-tune the model to ignore these. Our system significantly improves resistance to prompt injection attacks, with little or no impact on utility. Our code is released at https://github.com/Sizhe-Chen/PromptInjectionDefense.},

  abstract      = {Adversarial attacks have been a looming and unaddressed threat in the industry. However, through a decade-long history of the robustness evaluation literature, we have learned that mounting a strong or optimal attack is challenging. It requires both machine learning and domain expertise. In other words, the white-box threat model, religiously assumed by a large majority of the past literature, is unrealistic. In this paper, we propose a new practical threat model where the adversary relies on transfer attacks through publicly available surrogate models. We argue that this setting will become the most prevalent for security-sensitive applications in the future. We evaluate the transfer attacks in this setting and propose a specialized defense method based on a game-theoretic perspective. The defenses are evaluated under 24 public models and 11 attack algorithms across three datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet). Under this threat model, our defense, PubDef, outperforms the state-of-the-art white-box adversarial training by a large margin with almost no loss in the normal accuracy. For instance, on ImageNet, our defense achieves 62% accuracy under the strongest transfer attack vs only 36% of the best adversarially trained model. Its accuracy when not under attack is only 2% lower than that of an undefended model (78% vs 80%).},

  abstract      = {Existing works have made great progress in improving adversarial robustness, but typically test their method only on data from the same distribution as the training data, i.e. in-distribution (ID) testing. As a result, it is unclear how such robustness generalizes under input distribution shifts, i.e. out-of-distribution (OOD) testing. This is a concerning omission as such distribution shifts are unavoidable when methods are deployed in the wild. To address this issue we propose a benchmark named OODRobustBench to comprehensively assess OOD adversarial robustness using 23 dataset-wise shifts (i.e. naturalistic shifts in input distribution) and 6 threat-wise shifts (i.e., unforeseen adversarial threat models). OODRobustBench is used to assess 706 robust models using 60.7K adversarial evaluations. This large-scale analysis shows that: 1) adversarial robustness suffers from a severe OOD generalization issue; 2) ID robustness correlates strongly with OOD robustness, in a positive linear way, under many distribution shifts. The latter enables the prediction of OOD robustness from ID robustness. Based on this, we are able to predict the upper limit of OOD robustness for existing robust training schemes. The results suggest that achieving OOD robustness requires designing novel methods beyond the conventional ones. Last, we discover that extra data, data augmentation, advanced model architectures and particular regularization approaches can improve OOD robustness. Noticeably, the discovered training schemes, compared to the baseline, exhibit dramatically higher robustness under threat shift while keeping high ID robustness, demonstrating new promising solutions for robustness against both multi-attack and unforeseen attacks.},

  booktitle   = {The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations},
  abstract    = {We present a neural network architecture designed to naturally learn a positional embedding and overcome the spectral bias towards lower frequencies faced by conventional implicit neural representation networks. Our proposed architecture, SPDER, is a simple MLP that uses an activation function composed of a sinusoidal multiplied by a sublinear function, called the damping function. The sinusoidal enables the network to automatically learn the positional embedding of an input coordinate while the damping passes on the actual coordinate value by preventing it from being projected down to within a finite range of values. Our results indicate that SPDERs speed up training by 10x and converge to losses 1,500-50,000x lower than that of the state-of-the-art for image representation. SPDER is also state-of-the-art in audio representation. The superior representation capability allows SPDER to also excel on multiple downstream tasks such as image super-resolution and video frame interpolation. We provide intuition as to why SPDER significantly improves fitting compared to that of other INR methods while requiring no hyperparameter tuning or preprocessing.},
